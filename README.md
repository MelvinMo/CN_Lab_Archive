# CN_Lab_Archive
This repository comprises laboratory experiments and accompanying technical reports that demonstrate proficiency in computer networking concepts and technologies in the computer networks lab undergraduate course. The repository encompasses eight meticulously documented lab sessions that impart practical knowledge on essential topics including IP connectivity, network security, traffic analysis, routing protocols, VLAN switching, and Linux/Cisco IOS configuration. Additionally, the repository contains the culminating lab project, an original adaptive network design modeled and simulated in the Cisco Packet Tracer network emulator.

## Assignments
### Lab 1
This lab focuses on configuring IP addresses and testing connectivity in Windows through command-line tools. It covers IP addressing, ping, ipconfig, route, tracert, and nslookup.

### Lab 2
This lab is about configuring virtual networks in VMware. It covers creating virtual switches like bridges, NAT, and host-only. Virtual machines are configured, and connectivity is tested between them using ping.

### Lab 3
This lab covers Linux command-line file management. It uses commands like cat, cp, mv, rm, and touch to manage files.

### Lab 4
This lab is on using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic. It focuses on HTTP, DNS, and ICMP protocols.

### Lab 5
This lab focuses on configuring routing and access lists on Cisco routers. It covers configuring static routes, ACLs, and inter-VLAN routing. The routers are configured using the Cisco IOS command line and the Ciso packet tracer application.

### Lab 6
This lab focuses on configuring static routing and access control lists (ACLs) on Cisco routers. It covers configuring static routes and standard or extended ACLs to filter traffic. Access lists are applied to interfaces to implement security policies. The router configurations are verified using show commands.

### Lab 7
This lab focuses on configuring the OSPF routing protocol. It covers OSPF concepts like router ID, hello packets, DR/BDR, areas, and cost metrics.

### Lab 8
This lab focuses on configuring VLANs and inter-VLAN routing. It covers VLAN concepts, trunking using 802.1Q, and assigning ports to VLANs.

So the key topics covered across all the labs are:
- IP addressing and connectivity (Lab 1, Lab 2)
- Filesystem management (Lab 3)
- Packet capture and analysis (Lab 4)
- Routing configuration (Lab 5, Lab 6, Lab 7)
- Switching and VLANs (Lab 8)

## Project
This project encompasses the design and simulation of an enterprise network environment consisting of:
- Routing - Utilizing both static routing and dynamic routing protocol (RIP)
- Switching - VLAN configuration, trunk ports, inter-VLAN routing
- Services - DHCP, DNS, Web, Mail servers
- Security - ACLs for traffic filtering

The network is modeled in Cisco Packet Tracer and involves:
* Configuring the network topology and IP addressing
* Implementing VLANs on the switches
* Setting up trunk ports between switches
* Assigning switch ports to appropriate VLANs
* Enabling inter-VLAN routing on the layer-3 switch
* Configuring the routing protocol (RIP) on the routers
* Implementing essential network services like DHCP, DNS, Web, Mail servers
* Testing connectivity between different endpoints
